- 👋 Hi, I’m @KanalSuleyman – a Computer Engineering student with a focus on backend development using .NET Core and C#.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development, clean architecture, and building high-performance systems. I’m also keen on improving my knowledge in distributed systems and containerization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and .NET 8/C# 12, with a focus on microservices, CQRS, MediatR, RabbitMQ, and design patterns like Proxy and Decorator.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve backend technologies, API design, and building full-stack applications, where I can contribute and learn from others.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at suleyman-kanal@hotmail.com or through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/suleymankanal/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: The feeling of hitting a new squat PR is almost as satisfying as solving a tricky bug in my code—almost. 🔥
